### <a id="1814x"></a>v18.1.4

#### New Features

#### Issues Resolved

- Service backup now sends a [SIGTERM](index.html#preparing-files) to any running `backup_executable` when shutting down.
This ensures BOSH can perform lifecycle operations without issue.

### <a id="1813x"></a>v18.1.3

#### New Features

- Log files in `/var/vcap/sys/log/service-backup/*` are no longer truncated when the service-backup process restarts via Monit.
Pivotal recommends using [syslog-migration-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/syslog-migration-release) to ensure logs are not lost.

### <a id="1812x"></a>v18.1.2

#### <a id="new-features"></a>New Features

- Optionally specify `add_deployment_name_to_backup_path`.
- If set true will include deployment name in destination path.
- Use Golang v1.8.3 in the BOSH Release

#### <a id="bug-fixes"></a>Issues Resolved

- Service backup now will create a new S3 bucket even if endpoint_url is empty string.
- Document service-alerts in the BOSH release spec.
- When co-locating [syslog-migration-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/syslog-migration-release) or
[syslog-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/syslog-release) there would be duplicate log entries,
as service-backup was also writing it's logs to syslog.
Now ODB only writes logs to `/var/vcap/sys/log`, and anything syslog related
is handled by syslog-release or syslog-migration-release.
